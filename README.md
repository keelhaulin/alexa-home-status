# Alexa Home Status Skill (with Home Assistant)

## Overview
This project creates a **private Alexa skill** that delivers a **spoken summary** of your home's status from Home Assistant, using a Nabu Casa remote connection.

When you say:

> "Alexa, ask Home Status how's the house?"

Alexa responds with a dynamic summary based on live data from Home Assistantâ€”lights, doors, windows, garage, alarm, temperature, and humidity.
